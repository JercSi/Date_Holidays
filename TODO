- investigate whether it would be useful to add properties to a holiday [OK]
    -> string-prop, obj-prop ???
	-> Properties:
		- Description
		- History
		- Origin
		- Calculation
		- Importance
		- related holidays
- improve doc-comments (remove old stuff)
- enable factory to add custom drivers that don't belong to DH [OK]
- separate Christian driver into Catholic and Evangelic, let Germany extend none of these but use delegates instead
- performance:
 `- addCompiledTranslationFile()
 `- drivers with pre-built holidays???
