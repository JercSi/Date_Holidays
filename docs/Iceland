From http://www.isholf.is/gullis/jo/feasts_and_celebrations.htm
Þorri is one of the old Icelandic months. It always begins on
a Friday, between the 19th and the 25th of January, and ends on
a Saturday between the 18th and 24th of February. The first day
of Þorri is called Bóndadagur or "Husband's Day/Farmer's Day"
